    For our study, it is helpful to know a bit more about our participants.
    Below we ask a few general questions about you and your background.
    Remember that as with all decisions in todayâ€™s experiment, any information you choose to give is recorded anonymously,
    and will only be used in the analysis of the data from this experiment.
