{{ if termination }}
<p>
    You completed fewer than 20 sliders in the previous round.
    Therefore the Stage has now been terminated.
</p>
{{ endif }}

<p>
    Here is a summary of how many sliders you completed in each round:
    <ul>
    {% for p in player.in_all_rounds %}
        {% if p.participated %}
            <li>Round {{ p.round_number }}: <b>{{ p.num_correct }}</b> sliders.</li>
        {% endif %}
    {% endfor %}
    </ul>

    If this stage is chosen to determine your earnings for the experiment,
    your earnings would be <b>{{ potential_payoff }}</b>.
